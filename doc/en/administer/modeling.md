# Modeling

## Introduction

The modeling of data can specify how content is structured in the database and which input masks are created in the backend.

cms-kit different database models and generic models which allow different per entry, customized data structures.

Database models

About creating database models can create the tables in the databases. In addition, automatically function libraries are generated which allow developers an easy and secure access to the database.

How this works is here described.
Generic models

Generic models are fully enclosed, externally loadable input templates that allow you to use in an entry different structures. Thus, an entry times be a text field, sometimes a quiz and even a WHATEVER. Per entry can be an appropriate structure is loaded and displayed in the backend. Instead of in the database fields as generic models of cms-kit are as JSON stored structure and add, once loaded in the backend the entry to additional input fields. For the user there is no difference between "real" database fields that are the same for all entries and fields that were precisely "generated" for this entry. This document-oriented approach, scenarios can be realized, in particular, of NoSQL are addressed.

The Administration is here described.
