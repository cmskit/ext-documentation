# Documentation Database-Classes


In "Code>PHP" you can find some PHP-Files demonstrating the use of the auto-generated Database-Classes within your own Projects. This is somehow not complete and subject of change. The probably best start for Developers is to have a look into the generated ORM-Classes found in "your_project_folder/objects/"

However:

Code found in "**examples/**" are meant to get some ideas how to solve some common problems.

Code found in "**crud/**" are meant to describe[^1] the basic Object-Relational-Mapper-APIs.

[^1]: Most examples are modified Versions taken from <http://phpobjectgenerator.com>

If you have corrections or some useful Examples for this package let me know! (suggestions at cms-kit dot org)

have fun!
